I'm a professional software engineer from India. I specialize in full-stack development. 

I use multiple languages in my day-to-day work. Java and Spring Boot are the most notable backend technologies I work on along with JS(JavaScript) and NodeJS. I also work on the front end using JS and AngularJS.

I create content around Software Development, I have videos about interview questions and web development.

Consider subscribing to my [youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCBx3lI4R6bRGJhbiu4A_uCA) and share any feedback or positive criticism.

Want to know more about me outside of coding? 
You can also connect with me on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/jrk4real) and [Twitter](https://twitter.com/JayeshKarli).

I am looking forward to meeting excellent developers and people all over the world.
