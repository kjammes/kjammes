A software engineer from India. I love to work with javascript and typescript.

I create programming/coding content, I have videos about competitive programming HTML, CSS and I'll keep making content around javascript, javascript frameworks and many such similar technologies in future. Consider subscribing to my [youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCBx3lI4R6bRGJhbiu4A_uCA) and following me on [twitter](https://twitter.com/JayeshKarli) to stay up to date with everything.
