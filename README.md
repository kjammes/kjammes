I'm professional software engineer from India. I specialize in full stack development. 

I use multiple languages in my day to day work. Java and Spring Boot are the most notable backend technologies I work on alogn with JS(JavaScript) and NodeJS. I also work on front-end using JS and AngularJS.

I create programming/coding content, I have videos about interview questions and web development. 

Consider subscribing to my [youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCBx3lI4R6bRGJhbiu4A_uCA) and share any feedback or positive criticism.

Want to know more about me outside of coding? 
You can also connect with me on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/jrk4real) and [twitter](https://twitter.com/JayeshKarli).

Looking forward to meeting amazing new developers and people.
